# my-cv

This repository contains my CV. I used HTML and CSS to design it.
Bootstrap 4 is used to enhance the CSS design.
I also researched multiple websites such as W3Schools and ColorLib to research on the design of the webpages. Some of the inspirations for the design were drawn from the templates found in those sites.
CSS classes and files found in those sites were used for some designing purposes.

Thank You!
